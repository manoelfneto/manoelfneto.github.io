        <p>Using compartmental models and cellular automata, this work tried to understand and modeling the behaviour of
          the HPV. This is possible because the infection follow some rules to infect people and other laws when it is
          installed on humans bodies. The objective to model, is to simulate or simplifying how something works in the
          real world but using finite resources.
        </p>
        <p>Our world is a combination of a non deterministic, probabilistic, dynamic and exponential machines, thats why
          is so difficult to simulate that behaviour. So, we introduce the cellular automata, a discrete model, used to
          simulate complex behaviors and expose this in a visual way.
        </p>
        <p> Looking to the health side, the amount of the cases of STD (Sexually Transmitted Disease) has been
          increasing, according to the OMS (2018), this growth, is mainly on the younger part of the population, 15 to
          25 years old. The HPV is a virus with easy transmission because only needs dermal contact, and keeps on the
          latent state or without showing symptoms for months or even years, thereby, turning a person into a vector and
          spreading the infection.</p>

        <div>
          <p>Cellular automaton is a spatial model of temporal evolution, they can have one, two or three dimensions and
            are used to display and simulate natural behaviors based on predetermined rules. Is based on turing
            machines, that is, state machines that evolve according to transitions.</p>
          <p>One of the most known cellular automata is the Game of Life, developed by John Conway in 1970. The model
            evolution follow four simple rules: Any live cell with fewer than 2 neighbors dies by underpopulation; any
            live cell with more than 3 neighbors dies by overpopulation; any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors become a
            live cell; any live cell with 2 or 3 neighbors, unchanched, to the next generation. This laws generate
            cellular structures which simulate social behavior.

          <p>When we work with epidemiologic models, one known technique is used to classify the people in categories,
            or compartments, so comes up the compartment models. The main idea is to separate each being, based on their
            state on the instant t.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">HPV Virus</h2>

        <div>
          <p>HPV (Human Papillomavirus) is a virus from the family papillomaviridae with a double stranded DNA, when it
            is on symptomatic state, the disease develop warts, more known as condylomas, in mucous membranes like
            mouth, vagina and anus. The virus has more than 150 cataloged types. Classified as an STD, the virus is
            acquired frequently throughout sexual relations without protection, but also can be transmited by mother to
            fetus or sharing of contaminated objects. </p>
          <p>According to the statistics given by Dr. Waldemir Washington Rezende, part of the central institute of
            medicine college from USP, 75% of the women, during their life, will get in touch with some variant of the
            HPV virus. Fortunately, 95% of these cases will get better by spontaneous resolution of the organism, the
            remaining, who can not take care can developer cervical cancer in case of the wounds advance over time.</p>
          <p>For prevention, we have the same contraceptive methods used against the others STD and the vaccines given
            by the health system, in Brazil, to the girls who has 9 until 13 years old, this prevents the types 16, 18,
            11 and 6, which more cause cancer. Furthermore, there is the pap smear exam, which can detect the condylomes
            and the presence of the virus.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">The Model</h2>
        <div>
          <p>The experiment was made based on compartmental models and structured like a cellular automaton with two
            dimensions, a model which uses month as the time unit (each transition), working with the Moore
            neighborhood,
            it means, we consider the 8 neighbors around a cell. With predetermined rules, the automata can change the
            state of the individuals. The complexity and precision of the model increases proportionally the amount of
            the
            variable and laws applied to the cells.
          </p>
          <p>The first step was delimit the size of the matrix, that is, the quantity of the cells which
            would be part of the grid. The people’ rating also needed to respect statistics real data, therefore, was
            used
            real data from the census IBGE (Brazil - 2010). This information was extracted to delimit the amount of
            people
            in the age ranges, moreover, the number of individuals who are classified as virus carries, was taken from
            the
            research from Ministry of health (Brazil - 2018).</p>
          <p>The cell population was divided em age ranges like 15 to 25, 25 to 49 and 50 to 70 years old, each one with
            the quantities based on the census of the brasilian people, also accorind to the biological sex male and
            female. Focusing on the young population, to observe the results of the study, we consider that about 55% of
            the young (15 to 25 years old) had contact with the disease, this data was taken from the research from the
            Ministry of health (Brazil- 2018). </p>
          <p>Inside the model, the possibility to create new cells is given by the death of old cells, so, we have an N
            (number of individual) static, like was said before, but with the generating of new individuals, making the
            birth rate equals the mortality rate in the system. Is understandable that this harms the simulation of
            reality, but currently the simplicity of the model was preserved and after we can sophisticate and create
            new
            conditions on the research.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div class="subheading mb-3">The States</div>
          <p>With all the system based on compartmental models, was created boxes to classify the cells according to the
            state which they are. We made this to identify the individuals and make accounts, during the model
            execution, aiming at the follow amd compare with real database. The amount of the people in each state was
            previously determined statistically based on health data which contains age ranges about how many people got
            in touch with the virus. Initially, was generated 20 distinct cells, with mixed attributes according to the
            statistics. Was created three compartimental states represented by 0, 1 and 2 in the code.
          </p>
          <p>The first state is the susceptibility state, where most of the cells are, this means that those who are in
            this phase is fit to get the infection and it is up to the rules. From the array with 20 cells, 15 was
            initially set on the state 0, that is 75% of the closed population was in the state. This quantity includes
            half of the young population and a part of adult and old people, of both sexes.
          </p>
          <p>The second state already identified as infection is reached when the individual get in touch with the virus
            (the vector) but not developer symptoms yet, nevertheless, the person has the capacity to infect other, this
            will get a better approach in the next topic. The idea is that the automaton follow the contamination
            statistics from the young Brazilians.
          </p>
          <p>On the third state fit the people who start to manifest the symptoms, is who present the condylomes on the
            mucous region. This was the more difficult classification because there is no exact time or medium time to
            people began to manifest anything, some organisms take 2 months while others can take 20 years to show any
            indication of infection
          </p>
          <p>Knowing that HPV is a disease that has no cure, which the individual one contaminated keeps with any viral
            charge, we do not have a recovered state, like the basic model SIR suggest, to treat this case and to avoid
            that all cells in the grid get infected, was created a mechanism, which uma if one cell stay more than 12
            months infected, the cells is excluded from the matrix and the blank space is filled with a new cell.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <div class="subheading mb-3">The Transition Functions</div>
          <p>The rules of the model were developed to the cells change the states. For each state, there are some rules
            which need to be respected to the individual advance. They were created based on the natural condition of
            the acting of the pathology and use the attributes of each object (cell), the goal was to keep more closer
            as possible the reality.</p>
          <p>An individual located on the state 0, is susceptible to get the virus, to this, he needs to get in touch
            with another individual who has the disease. The big question is that, in the model, there are two types of
            cells which are infected, the ones which are on the state 1 (infected) and the ones which are on the state 2
            (infected and symptomatic), according to the INCA (Instituto Nacional de Cancer - Brazil), a person who has
            condylomas has more chances to infect a susceptible individual than other who has not the wounds, but we do
            not have an exact number of how bigger is that capacity, to cover this question, it was determined that
            cells in state 2 can infect more. We follow the rules below:
          </p>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>If the cell has more than 3 neighbors on state 1 or more than 2 neighbors on state 2 AND the age of
                the cell is between 16 and 25, it will get infected and goes to the state 1.</li>
              <li>If the cell has more than 4 neighbors on the state 1 or more than 3 neighbors on the state 2, it will
                get infected and goes to the state 1.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>The same way, the rules to the transition from the state 1 to state 2 was determined based on real
              events, like was said before, the difficult was determined the time which an organism take to developer
              symptoms. As we do not have an exact time, was set that:
            </p>
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>If an organism remain infected for 5 months, it will begin to present symptoms e goes to the states
                  2.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>One more condition is the way back, because a person can discover that she has the virus and start to
              treat the condylomas, so she will not present symptoms anymore, and then the cell needs to go back to the
              state 1. The rule is:
            </p>
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>If the infect time of the cell is more than 8, it goes back to the state 1.
                </li>
              </ul>

      <div>
        <p>After de automaton complete 60 transition, considering that the time of one transition is equal to one month,
          after 5 years, was observed some data about the amount of people infected compared to the whole, and compared
          with the non infected. But the focus here is to watch the number of female youths on the research. Bellow is
          the visual result of the automaton in four stages: 1, 12, 23 and 36 months.

          <img src="img/juntos.jpg" height="500" width="700">
        </div>
        <p>In the image, we can observe that on the first moment, about 75% of the cells are susceptibles (black), and
          the other 25% are divided on the most on infected (yellow) and a minority that are presenting symptoms (red),
          like in the real world, many people get the virus and do not know because they do not produce wound.
        </p>
        <p>Over the years, the amount of people infected, in the yellow and red compartmentals tends to increase with
          the dissemination of the virus, follow the trend of the other STD actually, mainly in the young part of the
          population, according to the data extracted from the simulation, about 50% of the young were infected,
          matching the reality, corresponding the research of the Ministry of health. </p>
